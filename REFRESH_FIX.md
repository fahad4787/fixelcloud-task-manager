# 🔄 Fix for "Page Not Found" on Refresh

## 🚨 Problem
When you refresh the page or directly visit a route like `/dashboard`, you get a "404 Page Not Found" error.

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Upload the .htaccess File
The `.htaccess` file in your `dist` folder is **CRITICAL** for fixing this issue.

**Make sure you upload the `.htaccess` file to your Hostinger public_html folder!**

### Step 2: Verify File Structure
Your `public_html` folder should look like this:
```
public_html/
├── index.html          ← Main app file
├── .htaccess          ← CRITICAL for routing
├── web.config         ← Alternative for IIS
└── assets/
    ├── css/
    ├── js/
    └── png/
```

### Step 3: Check File Permissions
In Hostinger File Manager:
- Files should have permission: **644**
- Folders should have permission: **755**

### Step 4: Alternative Solutions

#### If .htaccess doesn't work:
1. **Contact Hostinger Support** to enable mod_rewrite
2. **Use web.config** (already created) for IIS servers
3. **Try this simplified .htaccess**:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

## 🔧 Testing the Fix

1. **Upload the .htaccess file**
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Test these URLs**:
   - `https://yourdomain.com/` (should work)
   - `https://yourdomain.com/dashboard` (should work)
   - `https://yourdomain.com/login` (should work)
   - Refresh any page (should work)

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Check Hostinger Settings:
1. **Enable mod_rewrite**: Contact Hostinger support
2. **Check error logs**: In Hostinger control panel
3. **Try subdomain**: Sometimes works better than root domain

### Alternative Hosting Options:
If Hostinger continues to have issues:
- **Netlify**: Free, excellent for React apps
- **Vercel**: Free, built for React
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, works well with React

## 📞 Quick Fix Commands

If you have SSH access to Hostinger:
```bash
# Check if mod_rewrite is enabled
php -m | grep rewrite

# Check .htaccess syntax
apache2ctl -t
```
